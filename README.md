Created Bio for README.

My name is Dylan Crum I was born in Lubbock, Texas. I have 3 siblings, two older, one younger. I moved to Madison, Mississippi when I was 12 and have lived there since. I originally attended Mississippi State to study computer science, but realized I wanted more of a hands on lifestyle, so I switched into electrical engineering.
