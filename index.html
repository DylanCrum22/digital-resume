    <b>Mississippi State - Student Facilitator</b> I currently work with Mississippi State within classrooms to verify that class recordings
    for online students are recording seamlessly. I sit in classes to make sure a professors needs are met on how to record their class
    to best communicate with online students. I also oversee these videos once recorded and make sure to cut out any excess recording time. While doing this
    I also make note of any technical problems I may encounter in order to quickly fix them.
